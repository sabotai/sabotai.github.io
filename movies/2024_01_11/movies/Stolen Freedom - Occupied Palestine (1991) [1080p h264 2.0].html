        <td class="plot">During the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, that began in December 1987, Palestinian-American filmmaker Tony Kandah made the documentary &quot;Stolen Freedom&quot; about occupied Palestine and the Intifada. Filmed primarily in Dahatia, a refugee camp run by UNRWA near Bethlehem on the West Bank, the film shows a new side to this continuing saga; the story of children growing up and learning to survive in an atmosphere of daily tension. In eye-opening interviews, the young people explain what it means to live in a strife-torn environment and how they have managed to survive and remain hopeful. Narrated by Casey Kasem, well-known in the USA for his &quot;Top 40&quot; music program, and featuring commentary by Hanan Ashrawi.</td>
