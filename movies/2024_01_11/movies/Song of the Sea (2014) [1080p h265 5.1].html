When they resolve to return to their home by the sea, their journey becomes a race against time as they are drawn into a world Ben knows only from his mother&rsquo;s folktales. But this is no bedtime story; these fairy folk have been in our world far too long. It soon becomes clear to Ben that Saoirse is the key to their survival.</td>
