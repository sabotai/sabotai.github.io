# energyDrinkGame (crunch time?)
as of yet unnamed energy drink game (absurd)

## thoughts

 -speed of time passage based on how much liquid you catch
 -maybe you control both the person and the can above, set to different delays of mouse movement/touch
 -mouse could move in perfect unison on the table, indicating computer world is like megacool compared to things irl
 -sun/moon cycle on an elliptical journey across the window
 

 -balance heart exploding with falling asleep
